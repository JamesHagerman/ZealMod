# ZealMod

ZealMod is an Electron based GUI app that will allow you to change the keymaping and other settings on your Zeal60 based Mechanical Keyboard

This is a work in Progress and is mostly just a place holder for future development.

Right now, all it does is list the HID devices attached to the current machine.

## To Build

You'll need all the tools one would need to develop on an Electron app.

This project was initially built off of the `electron-react-boilerplate` found here: [https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate)

See the `Boilerplate-README.md` to see the original notes about how to get this thing running.
